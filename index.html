        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy collecting, and repairing, retro game consoles. Currently I focus on Nintendo consoles, <br>
            the only console I am missing from that line up is the Virtual Boy. I also collect games that I <br>
            either played growing up or I heard about from friends, but never had the chance to play. One of my <br>
            favorite games to have re-discovered is <b>Diddy Kong Racing</b> on the <b>Nintendo 64</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also like to play around with game development in my free time.  I like to try creating different <br>
            game mechanics and experimenting with how to implement said mechanics. Some mechanics are specific ones<br> 
            I pull from existing games, some are common to a variety of games, and others I come up with in spurts<br>
            of creativity. Not every game mechanic turns out, but I always end up enjoying the creative exercise it<br>
            gives, and learning new skills along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another interest of mine is 3D Printing and 3d Modeling. I've dabbled in 3D modeling for a few years and <br>
            have recently taken up 3D printing. Mostly I print things designed by others, however I've just started <br>
            working on making my own models for printing. Its taking a lot of trial and error, but I am enjoying the process.<br>
        </p>
